### Set the kind of object to be defined {#L2}

Set the `kind` key to specify the type of metadata object you're creating. In this case, set it to `Model` to indicate
that this is a data model definition. [Learn more](#model-model).

### Set the version of the metadata {#L3}

Ensure the `version` is set to a valid option. Most metadata objects are `v1`, but several have `v2`. This helps to
ensure compatibility and future-proofs your metadata against any breaking changes. [Learn more](#model-model).

### Define the model's structure and behavior {#L4-42}

In the `definition` key, you'll define the structure of your data model. A data model represents a collection of objects
of a particular type and supports one or more CRUD operations. You will also specify key details such as its `name`,
`objectType`, and configurations like filtering and sorting when it's exposed via your supergraph's GraphQL API.
[Learn more](#model-modelv1).

### Name your model {#L5}

Set the `name` of your model, which is how the data model will be referenced in the supergraph. This should reflect the
type of data the model represents, such as `Users`, `Articles`, etc. [Learn more](#model-modelname).

### Specify the object type {#L6}

The `objectType` is the specific type of objects that make up the model. This represents the definition of what each
object in the collection should conform to, like `User` or `Article`. You can learn more about creating
[types here](#model-customtypename).

### Indicate the globalIdSource {#L7}

Setting this value to `true` will allow you to fetch any object directly using its Global ID. This enhances API
flexibility by allowing clients to fetch objects across the schema with a single query, regardless of the object type.
[Learn more](/graphql-api/global-ids/).

### Define any arguments {#L8}

If you have any arguments you'd like to pass, you can add them to this array, which ensures a simplified request
structure when no additional filtering or customization is necessary. [Learn more](#model-argumentdefinition).

### Connect to your data source {#L9-11}

In the `source` section, configure how the model connects to your data source. Set the `dataConnectorName` to identify
the data connector that interfaces with the data source, and `collection` to specify which collection or table in that
data source the model maps to. [Learn more](#model-modelsource).

### Map arguments for the data source {#L12}

Use the `argumentMapping` key to map model arguments to data connector arguments, ensuring correct communication between
the model and the underlying data source. This allows flexibility in passing arguments through queries.
[Learn more](#model-argumentmapping).

### Apply a filter to your model {#L13}

Use the `filterExpressionType` to define the boolean expression type for filtering objects in this model. This is
crucial for performing conditional queries on the data. This will reference a
[`BooleanExpressionType` object](#model-customtypename) which defines specific operators to allow filtering when
querying this type.

### Enable aggregate queries on your model {#L14}

You can execute aggregate queries on your model, which will enable you to summarize and calculate properties of your
data, by referencing an [`AggregateExpression` object](/supergraph-modeling/aggregate-expressions/). This is useful when
you wan to return a total count, sum, average, etc.

### Enable orderable fields {#L15-22}

Define the fields that can be used to order the objects in this model by setting the `orderableFields`. Each field is
configured with an associated set of ordering directions (`Asc`, `Desc`, `EnableAll`) and maps to the various columns or
fields in your data source's collection. [Learn more](#model-orderablefield).

### Add fields to be sorted {#L16-18}

Specify the individual fields in `orderableFields` that will allow sorting of model objects in queries. Each field can
have different sorting behaviors enabled, but commonly `enableAll: true` allows sorting in both ascending and descending
orders. [Learn more](#model-orderablefield).

### Configure GraphQL queries {#L23-41}

Determine how objects can be queried. You can define root fields for both unique and many results. If this section is
omitted, the model wonâ€™t be exposed in the GraphQL API. [Learn more](#model-modelgraphqldefinition).

### Configure GraphQL queries for multiple entries {#L24-28}

In the `graphql.selectMany` section, define how multiple objects can be queried. The `queryRootField` is the field used
in the GraphQL schema to fetch all objects from the model that match the query parameters. You can also deprecate this
field and alert collaborators with a message. [Learn more](#model-selectmanygraphqldefinition).

### Configure GraphQL queries for unique entries {#L29-35}

In the `graphql.selectUniques` section, define how unique objects are queried. The `queryRootField` is exposed in the
GraphQL schema and allows you to select a unique object using its identifier. You can specify one or more fields in the
`uniqueIdentifier` array, providing flexibility in how unique objects are identified and queried. Like returning
multiple entries, you can deprecate this field as well. [Learn more](#model-selectuniquegraphqldefinition).

### Set order by behavior for GraphQL queries {#L36}

Configure the `orderByExpressionType` to define how objects from this model can be ordered in GraphQL queries. This
ensures consistent behavior for sorting results by fields. [Learn more](#model-modelgraphqldefinition).

### Set aggregates {#L37-39}

In the `aggregateDefinition` section, configure whether aggregate functions like `count`, `sum`, `avg`, and others
should be exposed for your model. [Learn more](#model-modelaggregategraphqldefinition).

### Configure Apollo Federation {#L40-41}

Use the `apolloFederation` section to determine if this model should be included in Apollo Federation. If
`entitySource: true`, the model will act as a source for fetching federated entities in the supergraph.
[Learn more](#model-modelapollofederationconfiguration) below and see our section on
[Apollo Federation](/graphql-api/apollo-federation/).

### Provide a description for your model {#L42}

The `description` field allows you to add a description for the model. This description will appear in the GraphQL
schema and provides context about the model's purpose and structure. [Learn more](#model-modelv1).
