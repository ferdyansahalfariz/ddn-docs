scanning your API endpoint for any publicly accessible models, youâ€™ll be alerted if any part of your system is not
secured, allowing you to take immediate action.

### Security Issue Resolution

This feature provides actionable insights on how to secure your supergraph, helping you implement necessary changes
without guesswork. Each detected issue is paired with recommended fixes to improve the overall security of your API.
