<p>
  Managing changes in a complex API ecosystem requires careful coordination
  and oversight. This section introduces you to Hasura's API change management tools, which help you track, compare, and
  manage modifications across your GraphQL schema versions.
</p>

<p>
  A Supergraph is typically composed of multiple subgraphs, each potentially managed by different teams or services.
  These subgraphs may, in turn, consist of one or more connectors. This hierarchical structure means that changes at the
  connector or subgraph level can impact the overall Supergraph.
</p>

<p>Our API change management tools provide features to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>List and manage Supergraph, subgraph, and connector builds</li>
  <li>Compare schema differences between versions</li>
  <li>Analyze the impact of changes on your API</li>
  <li>Ensure consistency and reliability across API modifications</li>
</ol>

<p>By utilizing these tools, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Track the evolution of your API over time</li>
  <li>Identify potential breaking changes before they affect your clients</li>
  <li>Coordinate updates across different teams and services</li>
  <li>Maintain a clear history of schema modifications</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you're making minor adjustments or implementing major changes, our API change management tools help you maintain control over your GraphQL schema's evolution, ensuring a smooth experience for both developers and end-users.</p>
