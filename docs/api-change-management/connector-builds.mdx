# Managing Connector Builds

This guide explains how to view and manage Connector builds in Hasura DDN using both the console and CLI.

## What is a Connector Build?

A Connector build contains the schema and metadata for a connector. Connectors are services that provide data to
subgraphs, and Connector builds are essential components in creating subgraph and supergraph builds.

## Viewing Connector Builds from the Console

To view and manage your Connector builds:

1. Log in to the Hasura DDN console.
2. Select your project (ensure you have at least one Connector build).
3. Navigate to the `Builds` section in the sidebar.
4. Select the `Connector Builds` tab.
5. You'll see a table listing all your Connector builds.
