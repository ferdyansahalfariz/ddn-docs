# Managing Supergraph Builds

This guide explains how to list and manage Supergraph builds in Hasura DDN.

## What is a Supergraph Build?

A Supergraph build is composed of multiple subgraphs, each potentially managed by different teams or services. Each
subgraph may consist of one or more connectors.

## Viewing Supergraph Builds

To view and manage your Supergraph builds:

1. Go to the Hasura DDN console.
2. Select your project (ensure you have at least one Supergraph build).
3. Navigate to the Builds section in the sidebar.
4. The Supergraph Builds tab will be selected by default.
5. You'll see a table listing all your Supergraph builds.

From the Supergraph Builds table, you can:

- View details of each build
- Delete a build
- Apply a build to your project

## Viewing Supergraph Builds from the CLI

Run the following command from the project directory to list all the Supergraph builds:

```bash
ddn supergraph build get
```

## Next Steps

If you don't have any Supergraph builds yet, check out our [Getting Started](/docs/3.0/getting-started/build/) guide to
create your first supergraph build.
