      <p>

        A Supergraph build may be composed of multiple subgraphs, each of which may be managed by different teams or
        services. So technically a Supergraph build is dependend on connector builds. And also for managing subgraphs efficiently
        we also have subgraph builds which can be composed to form a supergraph build.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        Hasura's build management tools help you manage changes to your subgraphs and ensure that your API
        changes are consistent and reliable.
