# Data Connectors

You can connect any kind of external data to Hasura DDN.

The connection to any cloud or local source is made via a [**data connector**](/connectors/overview.mdx), a piece of
software independent of the Hasura Engine.

A data connector is an HTTP service that exposes a set of APIs that Hasura Engine uses to communicate with the data
source. The data connector is responsible for interpreting work to be done on behalf of the Engine, using the
native query language of the data source.

## NDC Specification and SDKs

Connectors are built to conform to the [NDC Specification](http://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/) using one of
our available SDKs in [Rust](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-rs), [Go](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-go) or
[TypeScript](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-typescript), to enable anyone to connect rich, highly-native data sources
to their supergraph.

The NDC Specification defines a set of APIs that a data connector must implement. These APIs, which accept and return
JSON, are used by Hasura to communicate with the data connector. The NDC specification also defines a set of metadata
that the data connector must provide to Hasura. This metadata is used by Hasura to introspect the data connector,
generate the GraphQL schema, and execute operations against the data source.

## Available data connectors

You can use a data connector built by Hasura, one built by the community, or you can build your own. They can be
divided into three main categories:

### 1. Data Source Connectors

These connectors are built to connect to a specific data source. Anything from a database to a CSV file. One of the
main benefits of data connectors is that they can take advantage of each particular data source's native features and
optimizations.

### 2. Lambda Connectors

Lambda connectors such as the [Node.js TypeScript](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-nodejs-lambda/tree/main),
[Go](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-go-lambda),
and [Python](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-python-lambda) connectors are built to provide a way to execute
business logic for your API in a serverless environment and to configure and host these endpoints together with your
Hasura DDN infrastructure.

### 3. API Connectors

Existing REST and GraphQL APIs can be connected to your supergraph with our [NDC REST](https://github.
com/hasura/ndc-rest) and [NDC GraphQL](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-graphql) connectors.

## Using data connectors

Verified data connectors can be used directly via the [Hasura Connector Hub](https://hasura.
io/connectors/#connectors-list) using
the CLI. The Connector Hub is a managed list of connectors that you can use to connect to your data sources.

You can [build your own data connector](/connectors/build-your-own/index.mdx), or use one of the many connectors
available on the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors).

## Verified and non-verified connectors

### Verified connectors

Verified connectors are listed on the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors). These are deployable to Hasura DDN
using the Hasura CLI.

### Non-verified connectors

Non-verified connectors have not been verified by Hasura. These are only deployable on your own infrastructure.

## Deploy a connector to Hasura DDN

You can deploy any verified connector available on the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors) to Hasura DDN using
the CLI.

### Step 1: Initialize a new connector

To initialize a new connector, run the following in a project directory:

```bash
ddn connector init <connector-name> --subgraph <subgraph.yaml> -i
```

| Argument           | Description                                                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<connector-name>` | Whatever name you would like to assign to this connector.               |
| `<subgraph.yaml>`  | Path to the config file of the subgraph to which the connector belongs. |

You'll then need to choose the connector type and provide and env vars required by the connector, e.g. database
connection urls.

:::info Some connectors don't require any env vars

An example of this would be the Node.js Lambda TypeScript connector.

### Step 2: Introspect the connector data source

If your connector has an upstream data source, e.g. a Postgres database for the hasura/postgres connector, update the
connector configuration by introspecting the data source.

```bash
ddn connector introspect <connector-name> --subgraph <subgraph.yaml>
```

| Argument           | Description                                                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<connector-name>` | Whatever name you would like to assign to this connector.               |
| `<subgraph.yaml>`  | Path to the config file of the subgraph to which the connector belongs. |

### Step 3: Build and deploy the connector

You can then build and deploy your connector to Hasura DDN using the following command with the appropriate values from
the previous step:

```bash
ddn connector build create --connector <connector.yaml> --project <project-name>
```

| Argument           | Description                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `<connector.yaml>` | Path to connector config file. |
| `<project>`        | DDN project to deploy to       |
