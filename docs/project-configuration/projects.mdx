# Supergraph Projects

## Introduction

Projects exist both in the DDN cloud and locally on your machine. A project is the collection of metadata objects
which make up your supergraph, itself a collection of subgraphs.

## Local Supergraph Projects

### Initialize a new local project directory

New local projects are created with the `supergraph init` command. You can initialize a new project in a new directory
using the CLI by running:

```bash
ddn supergraph init <new-directory-to-create>
```

Specify `.` to initialize a project in the current directory. Your directory must be empty.

This will create:
- General YAML configuration and .env files for the project
- Docker compose and configuration files
- VSCode configuration files
- A globals supergraph with metadata objects for the supergraph as a whole
- A placeholder app subgraph with metadata objects for your subgraph
- An engine directory with configuration files
- A context file to hold current working context

See the [configuration](/project-configuration/config) section for more information.

### Running a supergraph project locally

**With the Docker daemon running on your machine**, you can immediately start the Hasura Engine, your supergraph and its
accompanying services.

```bash title="Run:"
ddn run docker-start
```

    The CLI and the `build` directory; click here to read how these work.
  </summary>
  The CLI automatically creates a `build` directory for you when running the `ddn supergraph init` command. This
  directory contains all of the JSON necessary to configure and serve your supergraph. The JSON files within it are
  already referenced for you in the docker `compose.yaml` file, allowing you to start your services straight away.

  The `docker-start` command is defined in your `hasura/context.yaml`. This command sets the `HASURA_DDN_PAT`
  environment variable using a value retrieved from the command `ddn auth print-pat` and then uses Docker Compose to
  start the Hasura services defined in the `compose.yaml` file. Your PAT is your personal access token generated by
  Hasura DDN and used by the CLI.

  <summary>
    Running the Docker daemon as a non-root user
  </summary>
  If you're running the Docker daemon as a non-root user (rootless mode), `v26.0` now allows you to disable the default
  `host-loopback-isolation` which prevents communication back to the host machine.

  To disable this feature, set the environment variable `DOCKERD_ROOTLESS_ROOTLESSKIT_DISABLE_HOST_LOOPBACK` to `false`
  before starting the daemon.

  This will now allow container-to-host communication via `10.0.2.2` address.

  You should also amend this line in your `compose.yaml` files for both the main services and connectors to reflect this
  change:

  ```yaml
  extra_hosts:
  - local.hasura.dev=host-gateway
  ```

  to:

  ```yaml
  extra_hosts:
  - local.hasura.dev=10.0.2.2
  ```

</details>

### View your supergraph API

You can launch your local project's console using the CLI.

```bash title="From a new terminal window, run:"
ddn console --local
```

This will open [`https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql`](https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql) and allow you to
view your API running on your own machine using the Hasura console.

:::tip Privacy settings in some browsers

Your browser settings, privacy tools or browser extensions may prevent the Console from accessing your local Hasura
instance. This could be due to features designed to protect your privacy and security. Should you encounter one of these
issues, we recommend disabling these settings for the `console.hasura.io` domain.

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) are the recommended
browsers for the best experience with the Hasura Console including for local development.

:::

### Create a new build of your supergraph

Hasura utilizes a system of [immutable builds](/project-configuration/builds.mdx) which provide a stable snapshot of
your API at any point in your development process.

```bash title="Let's create a new one:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The above command regenerates all the JSON for your supergraph. As we passed the `local` subcommand, this will
output the files to our local `./engine` directory by default, which is referenced in our Docker `compose.yaml`. We
won't see any difference to our deployed API from running this now, but once we start to add subgraphs and data
sources we'll need to run this command to update our API.

## Supergraph Projects on Hasura DDN

### Initialize a project on Hasura DDN based on the current local directory

To initialize a new project on Hasura DDN with subgraphs and connectors based on the current local directory, run:

```bash
ddn project init <project-name>
```

This command will create the project on Hasura DDN with all required subgraphs and connectors based on the current local
project directory. It will also create a new `.env.cloud` file. It will also set the DDN project name and .env.cloud
file in the local project context.

### Create a new empty project on Hasura DDN

You can create an empty project on Hasura DDN, not from a local project with the `create` command.

```bash
ddn project create
```

This command can be run anywhere. It will only be linked to a local project by providing the project name as context
by running the command:

```bash
ddn context set project <project-name>
```

This will add it as an entry in the `.hasura/context.yaml` file.

:::info Maximum number of projects on Hasura DDN

The maximum number of projects you can create on Hasura DDN is 150.

### Get Hasura DDN project details

You can get information on your project using the CLI by running:

```bash
ddn project get <project-name>
```

You will see an output similar to the following:

```text
+-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Name        | stunning-eagle-6335                                            |

### List all projects on Hasura DDN

You can get a list of all your projects using the CLI by running:

```bash
ddn project get
```

You will see an output similar to the following:

```text
+-------------------------------+-----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
