# Projects

## Introduction

Projects exist both in the DDN cloud and locally on your machine. A project is the collection of metadata objects
which make up your supergraph, itself a collection of subgraphs.

## Initialize a new local project directory

New local projects are created with the `supergraph init` command. You can initialize a new project in a new directory
using the CLI by running:

```bash
ddn supergraph init <new-directory-to-create>
```

Specify `.` to initialize a project in the current directory. Your directory must be empty.

This will create:
- General YAML configuration and .env files for the project
- Docker compose and configuration files
- VSCode configuration files
- A globals supergraph with metadata objects for the supergraph as a whole
- A placeholder app subgraph with metadata objects for your subgraph
- An engine directory with configuration files
- A context file to hold current working context

See the [configuration](/project-configuration/config) section for more information.

## Initialize a project on Hasura DDN based on the current local directory

To initialize a new project on Hasura DDN with subgraphs and connectors based on the current local directory, run:

```bash
ddn project init <project-name>
```

This command will create the project on Hasura DDN with all required subgraphs and connectors based on the current local
project directory. It will also create a new `.env.cloud` file. It will also set the DDN project name and .env.cloud
file in the local project context.

## Create a new empty project on Hasura DDN

You can create an empty project on Hasura DDN, not from a local project with the `create` command.

```bash
ddn project create
```

This command can be run anywhere. It will only be linked to a local project by providing the project name as context
by running the command:

```bash
ddn context set project <project-name>
```

This will add it as an entry in the `.hasura/context.yaml` file.

:::info Maximum number of projects on Hasura DDN

The maximum number of projects you can create on Hasura DDN is 150.

## Get Hasura DDN project details

You can get information on your project using the CLI by running:

```bash
ddn project get <project-name>
```
